- DO DOCUMENTATION AND WORKFLOW NOTES

FOLDERS

- Finish CRUD for folders

  ~~- Fix create folder where when we create a folder, use Node.js to create an actual folder inside the /Data/username/<FOLDER_NAME>~~

  ~~- Read folders list~~
  ~~- Delete folder~~
  ~~- READ folder~~

  - Finish Update operation for folder ==> rename folder

- fix where a user that does not has permission to access or delete a folder an error page message
  --> Create a specific error page for them (ex. Error 400 - You do not have access to this resource)

FILES

- Finish CRUD for files
  ~~- Create file with a folder (for now, create a file under a folder)~~
  ~~- Display image file~~

  - Display video file
    ~~- Read files (if there's no files associated with user, tell them that they have no files)~~

  - Update file ==> rename file && move file to another folder
    ~~- Delete files~~

  Nice to have features:

  - when reading files, we should have a folder that opens and shows the files underneath it (UI DESIGN)
  - Folder within a folder!!
